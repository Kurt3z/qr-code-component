## Overview

This was my first project to the Frontend Mentor challenges. It was a good experience, because it felt like a real world workflow where you receive a design of a component that you have to implement.
For this challenge I used solely HTML and CSS. To create the component layout I used Flexbox, and to recreate the mobile design used media queries.

### What I learned

I used this challenge to learn and apply Flexbox and layout skills, but the main takeway was the experience of a real scenario workflow, using Git and GitHub and recreating a design through code.
